# Coursera-Specialization-Course-in-Introduction-to-Programming-the-Internet-of-Things-IOT-


This repository contains my experience of Coursera's Introduction to Programming the Internet of Things (IOT) Specialization taught by renowned professor Ian Harris offered by the University of California, Irvine.
This Specialization covers basic embedded systems, the Raspberry Pi Platform, and the Arduino environment for building devices that can control the physical world. In the final Capstone Project, youâ€™ll apply the skills you learned by designing, building, and testing a microcontroller-based embedded system, producing a unique final project suitable for showcasing the amazing skills that you've learnt.
