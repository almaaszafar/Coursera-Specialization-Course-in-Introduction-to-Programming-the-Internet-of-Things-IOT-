## CAPSTONE DESIGN PROJECT
-> Design and build a more complex system

• Complexity of a design = Sum of complexities of individual components + Complexity of their integration together

•  Design process: MAKE REQUIREMENTS -> PUT ALTERNATIVES <-> ANALYSE -> CHOOSE

##  REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION

• Behavior of the systems: How the system acts 

• Must be understandable by the user:

-> Describe how to use the device

• Must be understandable by the designer:

-> Describe behavior completely

-> Describe rare cases and common cases

• Real world constraints:

-> Existing expertise (knowledge)

-> Competing designs and patents (creativity)

-> Financial limitations

-> Legal restrictions


## DESIGN PROCESS 

• System design:

• System-level design, large-scale design  For bigger decisions

• Design based to satisfy all constraints

• Evaluate all possible options and alternatives:
  1. Enumerate
  
  2. Evaluate

• System block diagram -> Show components and basic interconnections

• System decision:

• How will the behavior be divided into HW/SW components?

• Will components be pre-fabricated or built from scratch?

• Do component interfaces match?

• Decision based on constraints

## TESTING

• Component testing:

• Testing individual components

  1. Apply test data
  
  2. Observe test results

Test data should be complete -> Cover all possibilities (+ rare cases)
   
   • Integration testing:
   
   • Test groups of connected components together
   
   • Perform integration incrementally (one piece at a time, individually)
